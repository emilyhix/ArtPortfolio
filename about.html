        <h3>
            Born in Philadelphia in 1964, but primarily raised in a mid-west suburb of Chicago, Hix made his way to the downtown lofts of Los Angeles by the end of the 1990’s. At the age of 27, a serious, self taught study in art began to arise, and within a few years it had become a full-time vocation. Living at “The Brewery”, an artist community that opens their doors annually to thousands of the general public, gave ample opportunity to unveil many styles and techniques.
            Recent study has focused on figurative painting. Subject matter centers primarily on nature scenes, portraits of his family, literary icons, social rebels, and other heroes of the human spirit.
            Hix currently lives and paints in Riverside, CA.
